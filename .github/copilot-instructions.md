Security:  

- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities  

- Authentication/Authorization issues  

- Data protection  

- Input validation and escaping  

 

Performance:  

- Time complexity (O(n))  

- Resource usage  

- Database query efficiency  

- Memory management  

 

Code Quality:  

- SonarQube Metrics  

- SOLID principles  

- Clean code practices  

- Error handling  

- Documentation  

 

Issue Priority:  

- Functional errors  

- Logical inconsistencies  

- Critical security issues  

- Performance bottlenecks  

- Maintainability concerns  

 

Ignore:  

- Framework-provided security features  

- Code formatting  

- Minor style issues  

- Nitpicks  

 

Return your analysis as a list of Issues in this format. Use line break to separate the lines:
